For loop syntex :
 for( initialization ; condition ; updation ) 
 
 Flow:
 for loop checks the initialization only once then goes to condition and then updation;
 condition and updation are executed in loop ( again and again ) until condition becomes false of any ' break ' condition is met

Multiple variables initialization, multiple conditions and multiple updation
	syntax : for ( int a = 0, b = 1 ; a >= 0 && b <= 1; a--,b--)    //this is possible

for loop without any paramater goes to infinite loop, if break statetement is declared within the loop
	i.e for ( ; ; ) //this goes to infinite loop if no break statement is declared inside the loop


Break 
	break statement gets you out of the loop if certain condition is fulfilled
